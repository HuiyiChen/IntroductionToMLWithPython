Regression Models
* Regularization Parameter: alpha
    * Large values for alpha means "simple models"
    * Very important to tune in this parameter value
    * Usually searched for on a logarithmic scale.



Classification Models
* Regularization Parameter: C
    * Small values for C means "simple models"
    * Very important to tune in this parameter value
    * Usually searched for on a logarithmic scale.

L1 and L2 Regularization
* L1
    * If you estimate few features are important
    * If interoperability of the model is important
* L2
    * This is the default
    * If all of the features are important

!!!Linear models are very fast to train, and also fast to predict!!!
!!!Linear models often perform well when the number of features is large compared to the number of samples!!!


HOMEWORK:
* solver='sag' parameter: works on Logistic Regression and Ridge, this is faster on large datasets.
* SGDClassifier class
* SGDRegressor class
